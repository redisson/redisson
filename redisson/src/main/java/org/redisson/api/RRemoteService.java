/**
 * Allows to execute object methods remotely between Redisson instances (Server side and Client side instances in terms of remote invocation).
 * <p>
 * <b>1. Server side instance (worker instance).</b> Register object with RRemoteService instance. 
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * RRemoteService remoteService = redisson.getRemoteService();<br>
 * <br>
 * // register remote service before any remote invocation<br>
 * remoteService.register(SomeServiceInterface.class, someServiceImpl);
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * <b>2. Client side instance.</b> Invokes method remotely.
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * RRemoteService remoteService = redisson.getRemoteService();<br>
 * SomeServiceInterface service = remoteService.get(SomeServiceInterface.class);<br>
 * <br>
 * String result = service.doSomeStuff(1L, "secondParam", new AnyParam());
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * There are two timeouts during execution:
 * <p>
 * <b>Acknowledge (Ack) timeout.</b>Client side instance waits for acknowledge message from Server side instance.
 * <p>
 * If acknowledge has not been received by Client side instance then <code>RemoteServiceAckTimeoutException</code> will be thrown. 
 * And next invocation attempt can be made.
 * <p>
 * If acknowledge has not been received Client side instance but Server side instance has received invocation message already. 
 * In this case invocation will be skipped, due to ack timeout checking by Server side instance. 
 * <p>
 * <b>Execution timeout.</b> Client side instance received acknowledge message. If it hasn't received any result or error 
 * from server side during execution timeout then <code>RemoteServiceTimeoutException</code> will be thrown.
