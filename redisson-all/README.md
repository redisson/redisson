## Redisson standalone node

Redisson offers ability to run as standalone node and participate in distributed computing. Such Nodes are used to run [MapReduce](./9.-distributed-services/#95-distributed-mapreduce-service), [ExecutorService](./9.-distributed-services#93-executor-service), [ScheduledExecutorService](https://github.com/mrniko/redisson/wiki/9.-distributed-services#94-scheduled-executor-service) tasks or [RemoteService](./9.-distributed-services#91-remote-service) services. All tasks are kept in Redis until their execution moment.

Packaged as a single jar and could be [downloaded](https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=org.redisson&a=redisson-all&v=3.9.0&e=jar).
